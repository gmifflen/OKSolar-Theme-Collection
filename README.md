# OKSolar

Welcome to the OKSolar Theme Collection. Zack Voase refined the aesthetically-pleasing Solarized color scheme using the OKLab perceptual colorspace to provide a more consistant lightness, instead using chroma to provide needed emphasis

## Currently supported apps:

- JetBrains
- Godot

## TODO

- [ ] Replace sublate with a more up-to-date alternative
  - [ ] Possibly switch from Python, need to think on it more though.
- [ ] Add OKSolar to more things:
  - [ ] **Micro** - the best text editor
  - [ ] **VSCodium** - the 2nd best text editor
  - [ ] **MS Terminal** - for proprietary bros
  - [ ] **Kitty** - my terminal of choice
  - [ ] **Godot** - we makin' games
  - [ ] **Firefox** - cause chromium is a no-go, and more foss alternatives aren't yet up to snuff
    - [ ] Theme
    - [ ] Userstyle
  - [ ] **Discord** - chat in style
  - [ ] **Wallpaper** - for a more aesthetic desktop
  - [ ] **Phone wallpaper** - bring OKSolar with you wherever you go 
  - [ ] **Phone case** - style meets protection
  - [ ] **Bedroom walls** - sleep in OKSolar
  - [ ] **Kitchen walls** cook in OKSolar
  - [ ] **Cat** - nothing is safe
  - [ ] **Skintone** - become OKSolar
  - [ ] ...
  - [ ] Think of more things to make OKSolar
