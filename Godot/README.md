# Godot 4.x - Interface Theme (Godot Engine Interface)

The interface theme is a little more annoying to do :( 
I'm still trying to find a good way to do it, maybe something like how [bitbrain/godot-dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/godot-dash/tree/main) or [passivestar/godot-minimal-theme](https://github.com/passivestar/godot-minimal-theme/tree/main) do it, or 


Go to `Editor` --> `Interface` --> `Theme`

- Set your Base Colour to `#002d38`

- Set your Accent Colour to your choice of:
  - Yellow | #ac8300
  - Orange | #d56500
  - Red	| #f23749
  - Magenta	| #dd459d
  - Violet	| #7d80d1
  - Blue	| #2b90d8
  - Cyan	| #259d94
  - Green	| #819500 < My preferred choice

- Make sure contrast is at 0.1 [You can use 0 for a fully flat UI]
  - Contrast controls all the different BG colours of Godot which is annoying :(

- Optional:
  - Set Border Size to 1
  - Set Corner Radius to 4

# Godot 4.x - Syntax Themes (built-in script editor) **TBD**
Place the `.tet` files in your Godot text editor theme directory:

`Editor` --> `Open Editor Data/Settings Folder`
then select OKSolar under `Editor` --> `Text Editor` --> `Theme`
